# -----------------------------------------------------------
# How to calculate a Life Path Number:
#
# https://www.tokenrock.com/numerology/life_path/
# RULE 1
# The correct way to calculate the Life Path Number is to group the Month, Day, and Year,
# and add them individually, reduce to a single number for each, then reduce them to a single number.
# 
# Birth Date: May 4, 1977
#
# May = 5
# 4 = 4
# 1977 = (1 + 9 + 7 + 7) = 24 = (2 + 4) = 6
#
# Then add the totals from each above group
# (5 + 4 + 6) = 15 = (1 + 5) = 6
#
# RULE 2
# Next lets look at the second rule. Do not reduce the Numbers 11 or 22 (1 + 1 = 2 or 2 + 2 = 4)
# if they show up in the groups during the calculation, until the final calculation.
#
# Birth Date: July 29, 1974
#
# July = 7
# 29 = (2 + 9) = 11 (Do Not Reduce)
# 1974 = (1 + 9 + 7 + 4) = 21 = (2 + 1) = 3
# (7 + 11 + 3) = 21 = (2 + 1) = 3
#
# RULE 3
# If final calculation is 33 return 33.
# Note No years add to 33 from 1-5000 except for 33.
#
# TODO(dew): Checking with numerologist on if 33 is reduced
